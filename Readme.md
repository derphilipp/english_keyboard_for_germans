# English Keyboard for Germans

This is an OS X keyboard layout for people who need to enter German 
Umlauts and the *ß* symbol while keeping an english keyboard layout.

The file can be loaded with [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele).

## Idea
In contrast to the english keyboard, the default german keyboard has very
cumbersome access to symbols like \[ or \{.

On the other hand it is cumbersome to enter German Umlauts with an
english keyboard layout.

This keyboard layout uses an english keyboard layout as basis and
adds German Umlauts (and the *ß* Symbol).

The German Umlauts are activated with the Alt-key, combined with the
button where the Umlaut Keys are on German keyboards.

Example:

| Keypress         | Produced Character |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Alt + ;          | ö                  |
| Alt + Shift + \[ | Ü                  |
| Alt + -          | ß                  |



## Installation
Install [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele), and open the 
provided .keyboard layout file.
After (optional) customizing the keyboard further, save the new keyboard 
as bundle.

Copy the generated bundle file to 
```
~/Library/Keyboard Layouts
```
to enable it for use for the current user or to
```
/Library/Keyboard Layouts
```
to enable it for use for all users on the system.

To use the keyboard, select it in *System Preferences* -> *Keyboard*
